                <b>Overview:</b><br>
                Welcome to the bespoke post maker, which allows even the least technical of the outreach team
                to seamlessly create beautiful standardised posts (or something like that).<br>
                NOTE: All fields are required and the post will not upload without all.<br>
                NOTE: From login, you have 30 minutes to complete your post before the credentials expire. For this reason, it is 
                recommended to draft posts in a separate text editor such as LibreOffice, Docs, or Word (in order of preference).
                <br><br>
                <b>Title:</b><br>
                Very simply, just type the desired title of the post into the box labelled title.
                <br><br>
                <b>Content:</b><br>
                This is the main text of the post which appears beneath the title when the post has been clicked, and is being 
                displayed. Here (and only here), square brackets, [], can be used in conjunction with a string to represent an image, such as [image.png], 
                or [1.jpeg]. These will be uploaded later, so please ensure you remember the file names correctly when adding images. 
                Trying to upload content with image tags that cannot be fulfilled (because the needed files have not been uploaded) 
                will result in an error, not allowing upload to continue.
                <br><br>
                <b>Description:</b><br>
                This is what users will see when your post is published and on the home page. This field is character limited to 255 
                characters to keep things standardised and punchy. This should summarise what is discussed in your main content. 
                Image tags cannot be used.
                <br><br>
                <b>File upload:</b><br>
                This is where the images found in the image tags from earlier can be uploaded, in a folder. This folder must contain all 
                images used in the content image tags <b>and</b> a thumbnail image with; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- a 1:1 aspect ratio (it is as wide as it is high)<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- the name thumbnail.{file extension (png, jpeg, etc)} (Case sensitive)<br>
                An error will occur if this file is missing
